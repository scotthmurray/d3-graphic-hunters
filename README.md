# d3-graphic-hunters

These code examples accompany the [online data visualization D3.js training](https://graphichunters.nl/online-data-visualisation-d3-js/) offered through [Graphic Hunters](https://graphichunters.nl/).

**NOTE:** These examples use version 7.4.4 of D3.  That is the current version of D3 as of this writing (June 1, 2022), but if you are exploring this repo at some distant point in the future (itâ€™s possible  ðŸ¤·), please note that:

- there may be a newer version of D3 available
- these code examples may need revisions in order to work with some future version of D3

Some of these examples are adapted from the sample code files for *Interactive Data Visualization for the Web, 2nd Ed.* (Oâ€™Reilly, August 2017).  See [d3book.com](http://d3book.com).
